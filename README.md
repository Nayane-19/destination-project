# Travel Destinations

This is a React application with TypeScript that allows users to search for travel destinations and view details about them. The application also suggests nearby destinations based on the selected destination.

## Design Decisions

- **React with TypeScript**: Chosen to ensure type safety and better code maintenance.
- **React Query**: Used to efficiently manage data fetching state.
- **Context API**: Used to manage the global state of the selected destination.
- **ShadCN**: Used to provide accessible and styled UI components.
- **Component Structure**: Divided into small, reusable components for better organization.
- **Fake API**: Simulates data fetching to facilitate development and testing.
